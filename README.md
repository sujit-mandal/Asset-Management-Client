# How I manage state in this Project?

Managing state in a React project using the useState and useEffect hooks is a common and effective approach. These hooks allow you to handle component-level state and side effects in a functional component. Here's a general outline of how to managed state in your React project using these hooks:

### 1. Import necessary dependencies

- First of all imported React hook at the top of the component file.

### 2. Initialize State Variables

- Declared state variables using the useState hook.

### 3. Update State Variables

- Updated state variables via set state variable function for component's JSX to display dynamic content.

### 4. Manage Side Effects with "useEffect"
